# 🧠 AI Blog Repository

Welcome to the **AI Blog** — a Markdown-based blog archive exploring various aspects of Artificial Intelligence. This repository is organized with **dedicated branches** for different topics, themes, or eras in AI, allowing for clean separation of ideas and structured knowledge growth.

## 📌 About This Repository

This is not a typical blog website. Instead, it's a Git-based blog system using Markdown `.md` files. Each branch serves as a curated collection of blog posts around a specific topic or trend in AI.

If you're interested in:
- The evolution of agentic AI
- Deep dives into machine learning
- Reflections on the societal impact of AI
- Notes on AI tools, papers, and frameworks

...then this repo is for you.
